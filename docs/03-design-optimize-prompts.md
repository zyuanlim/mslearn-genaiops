# Design and optimize prompts

This exercise takes approximately **40 minutes**.

> **Note**: This lab assumes a pre-configured lab environment with Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, and Python already installed.

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll test prompt optimizations for the Adventure Works Trail Guide Agent using a Git-based experimentation workflow. You'll first establish a quantified baseline using the current production prompt, then create experiment branches to test optimization variants. You'll run automated scripts to capture agent responses, manually score quality, and compare results to make evidence-based decisions about which optimization to deploy to production.

**Scenario**: You're operating the Adventure Works Trail Guide Agent with a v3 production prompt. Before optimizing, you'll measure baseline performance. Then you'll test if a token-optimized prompt (v4) can maintain quality while reducing costs by 40-50%. Finally, you'll test the same optimized prompt with the GPT-4.1-mini model to see if it can further reduce costs while maintaining acceptable quality.

## Set up the environment

To complete the tasks in this exercise, you need:

- Visual Studio Code
- Azure subscription with Microsoft Foundry access
- Git and [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- Python 3.9 or later
- Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI (azd) installed

> **Tip**: If you haven't installed these prerequisites yet, see [Lab 00: Prerequisites](00-prerequisites.md) for installation instructions and links.

All steps in this lab will be performed using Visual Studio Code and its integrated terminal.

### Create repository from template

You'll start by creating your own repository from the template to practice realistic workflows.

1. In a web browser, navigate to the template repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) at `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-genaiops`.
1. Select **Use this template** > **Create a new repository**.
1. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `mslearn-genaiops`).
1. Set the repository to **Public** or **Private** based on your preference.
1. Select **Create repository**.

### Clone the repository in Visual Studio Code

After creating your repository, clone it to your local machine.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+P**.
1. Type **Git: Clone** and select it.
1. Enter your repository URL: `https://github.com/[your-username]/mslearn-genaiops.git`
1. Select a location on your local machine to clone the repository.
1. When prompted, select **Open** to open the cloned repository in VS Code.

### Deploy Microsoft Foundry resources

Now you'll use the Azure Developer CLI to deploy all required Azure resources.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open a terminal by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu.

1. Authenticate with Azure Developer CLI:

    ```powershell
    azd auth login
    ```

    This opens a browser window for Azure authentication. Sign in with your Azure credentials.

1. Authenticate with Azure CLI:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

    Sign in with your Azure credentials when prompted.

    > ⚠️ **Important**
    > In some environments, the VS Code integrated terminal may crash or close during the interactive login flow.
    > If this happens, authenticate using explicit credentials instead:
    > ```powershell
    > az login --username <your-username> --password <your-password>
    > ```

1. Provision resources:

    ```powershell
    azd up
    ```

    When prompted, provide:
    - **Environment name** (e.g., `dev`, `test`) - Used to name all resources
    - **Azure subscription** - Where resources will be created
    - **Location** - Azure region (recommended: Sweden Central)

    The command deploys the infrastructure from the `infra\` folder, creating:
    - **Resource Group** - Container for all resources
    - **Foundry (AI Services)** - The hub with access to models like GPT-4.1
    - **Foundry Project** - Your workspace for creating and managing prompts
    - **Log Analytics Workspace** - Collects logs and telemetry data
    - **Application Insights** - Monitors performance and usage

1. Create a `.env` file with the environment variables:

    ```powershell
    azd env get-values > .env
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Important – File Encoding**
    >
    > After generating the `.env` file, make sure it is saved using **UTF-8** encoding.
    >
    > In editors like **VS Code**, check the encoding indicator in the bottom-right corner.  
    > If it shows **UTF-16 LE** (or any encoding other than UTF-8), click it, choose **Save with Encoding**, and select **UTF-8**.
    >
    > Using the wrong encoding may cause environment variables to be read incorrectly.

    This creates a `.env` file in your project root with all the provisioned resource information.

### Install Python dependencies

With your Azure resources deployed, install the required Python packages.

1. In the VS Code terminal, create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```powershell
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This installs necessary dependencies including:
    - `azure-ai-projects` - SDK for working with Microsoft Foundry
    - `azure-identity` - Azure authentication
    - `python-dotenv` - Load environment variables

1. Add the agent configuration to your `.env` file:

    Open the `.env` file in your repository root and add:

    ```
    AGENT_NAME="trail-guide"
    MODEL_NAME="gpt-4.1"
    ```

## Understand the experimental workflow

The repository contains the Trail Guide Agent, along with folders for testing and experiments:

```text
mslearn-genaiops/
├── experiments/
│   ├── baseline/

        └── run_batch_tests.py          # Batch script to test agent with all prompts
```

**Workflow per experiment:**

1. Create experiment branch
2. Modify `trail_guide_agent.py` to point to the prompt variant being tested
3. Run `trail_guide_agent.py` to create/update agent version
4. Run `src/tests/run_batch_tests.py` to test agent with all prompts
5. Manually score responses in CSV
6. Compare results and merge winner

## Establish baseline

Before testing optimizations, establish a baseline by deploying and evaluating the current production prompt (v3).

### Why baseline first?

The baseline provides:

- **Reference point** - Quantify actual improvement from optimizations
- **Quality floor** - Ensure experiments don't degrade below current performance
- **Token benchmark** - Measure cost reduction from optimization

### Deploy baseline agent

1. Verify you're on the main branch:

    ```powershell
    git checkout main
    ```

1. Open `src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py` and make sure the baseline configuration uses the v3 prompt and GPT-4.1 model.

    If you completed Lab 02 already, the file may already be configured for `v3_instructions.txt`.
    If you're starting directly from the template repository, confirm these two settings before continuing:

    The `prompt_file` assignment should be:

    ```python
    prompt_file = Path(__file__).parent / 'prompts' / 'v3_instructions.txt'
    ```

    The `model=` setting should be:

    ```python
    model=os.getenv("MODEL_NAME", "gpt-4.1"),
    ```

1. If you changed the file in the previous step, save it and commit the baseline configuration on `main`:

    > ⚠️ **First-time Git setup**
    >
    > If Git reports `Author identity unknown`, configure your identity once before committing:
    > ```powershell
    > git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
    > git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
    > ```

    ```powershell
    git add src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    git commit -m "Set baseline agent configuration to v3 prompt"
    ```

    If the commit reports there is nothing to commit, the file already matched the required baseline configuration and you can continue.

1. Deploy the baseline agent:

    ```powershell
    python src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    ```

    This creates the "trail-guide-agent" with your v3 prompt.

### Run baseline tests

1. Run batch tests to capture baseline responses:

    ```powershell
    python src/tests/run_batch_tests.py baseline
    ```

    This tests all 5 prompts and saves results to `experiments/baseline/agent-responses.json`.

1. Review the captured responses:

    ```powershell
    cat experiments/baseline/agent-responses.json
    ```

### Score baseline responses

Create your baseline evaluation scores.

1. Check if it created or create `experiments/baseline/evaluation.csv`:

    ```csv
    test_prompt,agent_response_excerpt,intent_resolution,relevance,groundedness,comments
    day-hike-gear,"For a summer day hike in moderate terrain, essential gear includes...",5,5,4,Clear and comprehensive gear list
    overnight-camping,"For your first overnight camping trip, start with these essentials...",4,4,5,Good beginner advice with safety focus
    three-day-backpacking,"Critical safety considerations for October mountain backpacking...",5,5,5,Excellent detailed safety guidance
    winter-hiking,"Winter hiking requires additional gear and precautions...",4,4,4,Good comparison of seasonal differences
    trail-difficulty,"To assess trail difficulty for your fitness level as a beginner...",5,5,5,Helpful framework for self-assessment
    ```

    > **Tip**: Use the actual responses from `agent-responses.json` to score accurately.

You now have a quantified baseline to compare optimizations against.

## Run optimization experiment 1: Token reduction

Test the optimized-concise prompt (v4) which reduces token usage while maintaining quality.

### Create experiment branch

Each optimization experiment lives in its own branch, keeping experimental changes separate from your production agent.

1. In the VS Code terminal, ensure you're in the repository root:

    ```powershell
    cd /path/to/mslearn-genaiops
    ```

1. Ensure you're on the main branch with latest changes:

    ```powershell
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

1. Create an experiment branch for testing the optimized-concise prompt:

    ```powershell
    git checkout -b experiment/optimized-concise
    ```

    > **Note**: Using `experiment/` prefix clearly identifies this as an experimental change.

### Verify test prompts exist

The test prompts are already created in the `src/tests/test-prompts/` folder.

1. List the test prompt files:

    ```powershell
    ls src/tests/test-prompts/
    ```

    You should see:
    - `day-hike-gear.txt` - Essential gear question
    - `overnight-camping.txt` - First camping trip prep
    - `three-day-backpacking.txt` - Extended trip safety
    - `winter-hiking.txt` - Seasonal gear differences
    - `trail-difficulty.txt` - Beginner trail assessment

1. Examine one of the test prompts:

    ```powershell
    cat src/tests/test-prompts/day-hike-gear.txt
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    What essential gear do I need for a summer day hike in moderate terrain?
    ```

These test prompts represent realistic user scenarios you'll use to evaluate each prompt variant.

### Configure agent for the experiment

Modify the agent script to use the optimized-concise prompt (v4).

1. Open `src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py` and update the `prompt_file` assignment to point to v4:

    ```python
    # Change from:
    prompt_file = Path(__file__).parent / 'prompts' / 'v3_instructions.txt'
    
    # To:
    prompt_file = Path(__file__).parent / 'prompts' / 'v4_optimized_concise.txt'
    ```

1. Save the file and commit this change to your experiment branch:

    ```powershell
    git add src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    git commit -m "Configure agent to use v4 optimized-concise prompt"
    ```

    If `git commit` reports there is nothing to commit, confirm the file already points to `v4_optimized_concise.txt` and then continue.

### Deploy agent and run batch tests

Deploy the agent with the v4 prompt and capture responses from all test prompts.

1. Create/update the agent version from the repository root:

    ```powershell
    python src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    Agent created (id: asst_abc123, name: trail-guide, version: 2)
    ```

1. Run the batch test script to test with all prompts:

    ```powershell
    python src/tests/run_batch_tests.py optimized-concise
    ```

    The script will:
    - Find the deployed agent by name
    - Run each test prompt through the agent
    - Capture responses with token usage metadata
    - Save results to `experiments/optimized-concise/agent-responses.json`

    Expected output:
    ```
   Running 5 test prompts for experiment: optimized-concise
    ================================================================================
    Using agent: trail-guide (id: asst_abc123, version: 2)

    Testing: day-hike-gear
       Prompt: What essential gear do I need for a summer day hike...
       Response captured (245 tokens)

    Testing: overnight-camping
       Prompt: How should I prepare for my first overnight camping...
       Response captured (312 tokens)

    Testing: three-day-backpacking
       Prompt: I'm planning a 3-day backpacking trip in the mountains...
       Response captured (385 tokens)

    Testing: winter-hiking
       Prompt: What additional gear and precautions do I need for...
       Response captured (298 tokens)

    Testing: trail-difficulty
       Prompt: How do I know if a trail is appropriate for my...
       Response captured (267 tokens)

    ================================================================================
    Results saved to: experiments/optimized-concise/agent-responses.json
    Total tests: 5
    Total tokens used: 1507
    ```

1. Review the captured responses:

    ```powershell
    cat experiments/optimized-concise/agent-responses.json
    ```

    The JSON file contains structured data with test names, prompts, responses, and token usage.

### Score responses manually

Review the agent responses and create an evaluation CSV with quality scores.

1. Create a new file `experiments/optimized-concise/evaluation.csv`:

    ```powershell
    New-Item experiments/optimized-concise/evaluation.csv
    ```

1. Open the file in VS Code and verify or add the CSV header and scores:

    ```csv
    test_prompt,agent_response_excerpt,intent_resolution,relevance,groundedness,comments
    day-hike-gear,"Essential gear for summer moderate terrain day hikes...",5,5,4,Maintains quality with reduced verbosity
    overnight-camping,"First overnight camping essentials...",4,5,5,More direct while preserving safety focus
    three-day-backpacking,"October mountain backpacking safety priorities...",5,5,5,Excellent concise safety guidance
    winter-hiking,"Winter vs summer gear additions...",5,4,4,Clear comparison without excess detail
    trail-difficulty,"Beginner trail difficulty assessment...",5,5,5,Helpful and actionable guidance
    ```

    Scoring criteria (1-5 scale):
    - **Intent Resolution**: Did the response address what the user asked?
    - **Relevance**: Is the response on-topic and appropriate?
    - **Groundedness**: Are claims factually accurate?

    > **Tip**: Align your evaluation format with what Microsoft Foundry portal exports. Consistent criteria across manual testing, portal evaluations, and automated testing makes it easy to consolidate results.

1. Commit your experiment results:

    ```powershell
    git add experiments/optimized-concise/
    git commit -m "Complete optimized-concise experiment with evaluation"
    git tag experiment-1-optimized-concise
    ```

## Run optimization experiment 2: Model comparison

Test the same optimized prompt (v4) with the GPT-4.1-mini model to explore cost vs. quality tradeoffs.

### Investigation goal

Determine if GPT-4.1-mini can maintain acceptable quality while providing additional cost savings beyond prompt optimization alone.

### Run the experiment

1. Create a new experiment branch:

    ```powershell
    git checkout experiment/optimized-concise
    git checkout -b experiment/gpt41mini
    ```

1. Modify `src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py` to use GPT-4.1-mini model.

    Update the `model=` setting to change the model:
    
    ```python
    # Change from:
    model=os.getenv("MODEL_NAME", "gpt-4.1"),
    
    # To:
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    ```

    Because this branch starts from `experiment/optimized-concise`, the `prompt_file` assignment should already point to `v4_optimized_concise.txt`. If it does not, update it before running the experiment.

1. Commit this configuration:

    ```powershell
    git add src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    git commit -m "Configure agent to use GPT-4.1-mini model with v4 prompt"
    ```

1. Deploy the agent with GPT-4.1-mini:

    ```powershell
    python src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    ```

1. Run batch tests with the same test prompts:

    ```powershell
    python src/tests/run_batch_tests.py gpt41mini
    ```

1. Create your evaluation CSV at `experiments/gpt41mini/evaluation.csv`:

    ```csv
    test_prompt,agent_response_excerpt,intent_resolution,relevance,groundedness,depth,comments
    day-hike-gear,"For summer day hikes on moderate terrain...",4,4,4,3,Good coverage but less detailed than GPT-4
    overnight-camping,"First overnight camping essentials include...",4,4,4,3,Solid advice, slightly less nuanced
    three-day-backpacking,"October mountain safety priorities...",4,4,4,4,Good safety guidance, concise
    winter-hiking,"Winter hiking requires additional gear...",4,4,4,3,Clear comparison, adequate detail
    trail-difficulty,"To assess trail difficulty as a beginner...",4,4,4,4,Practical framework provided
    ```

1. Commit experiment results:

    ```powershell
    git add experiments/gpt41mini/
    git commit -m "Complete GPT-4.1-mini experiment with evaluation"
    git tag experiment-2-gpt41mini
    ```

    > **Note**: Keep the model change in trail_guide_agent.py committed on this branch. When you switch back to main, the script will revert to GPT-4.

## Compare experiments and decide

After completing baseline and both optimization experiments, use your CSV data to make evidence-based decisions about which variant to promote to production.

### Review all experiment branches

1. List all experiment branches:

    ```powershell
    git branch | Select-String "experiment/"
    ```

    You should see:
    ```
    experiment/gpt41mini
    experiment/optimized-concise
    ```

1. Review the baseline results from `experiments/baseline/` on `main`, then compare them with the results captured on the two experiment branches.

### Compare results across experiments

Use the CSV files to compare experiments side-by-side.

1. Open all three CSV files for comparison:

    ```powershell
    code experiments/baseline/evaluation.csv
    code experiments/optimized-concise/evaluation.csv
    code experiments/gpt41mini/evaluation.csv
    ```

1. Review the scores across all three experiments to compare quality:

    Look for patterns in the CSV data:
    - Which experiment has consistently higher scores?
    - Are there specific test prompts where quality differs significantly?
    - How do token counts compare across experiments?

1. Make your decision based on the data:

    **Winner: `optimized-concise` (v4 prompt with GPT-4)**
    
    Rationale:
    - Maintains or improves quality across test cases
    - Significant token reduction (42% fewer tokens)
    - Better cost-to-quality ratio than GPT-4.1-mini
    
    Alternative consideration: GPT-4.1-mini could be used for simple, high-volume queries if cost is critical.

### Merge winning experiment

Use Git to merge the winning experiment to main.

1. Checkout main branch:

    ```powershell
    git checkout main
    ```

1. Merge the winning experiment:

    ```powershell
    git merge experiment/optimized-concise -m "Merge optimized-concise prompt experiment

Approved optimization reduces prompt tokens by 42% while maintaining quality.

- Validated with 5 production test cases
- Quality criteria met across all test prompts
- Cost savings: 42% reduction in completion tokens
- Ready for production deployment

Evaluation results: experiments/optimized-concise/evaluation.csv"
    ```

1. Verify the merged `trail_guide_agent.py` still uses the winning prompt:

    Open `src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py` and confirm the `prompt_file` assignment still points to `v4_optimized_concise.txt`:

    ```python
    prompt_file = Path(__file__).parent / 'prompts' / 'v4_optimized_concise.txt'
    ```

    If the merge completed without conflicts, this change should already be present and no additional edit is required.

1. If you had to resolve a merge conflict in the previous step, commit the resolved file:

    ```powershell
    git add src/agents/trail_guide_agent/trail_guide_agent.py
    git commit -m "Update agent to use optimized-concise prompt (v4)"
    ```

    Otherwise, skip this commit because the merge commit already contains the prompt change.

1. Create a production release tag:

    ```powershell
    git tag -a v4-optimized-prompt -m "Release v4: Token-optimized prompts

Changes:

- Deployed v4_optimized_concise.txt prompt variant
- 42% token reduction validated
- Quality maintained across all test scenarios

Migration: Update trail_guide_agent.py to use v4_optimized_concise.txt"
    ```

1. Push changes to GitHub:

    ```powershell
    git push origin main
    git push origin experiment/optimized-concise
    git push origin experiment/gpt41mini
    git push --tags
    ```

    Your experiments are now saved with full history on GitHub, making them easy to review and reference.
